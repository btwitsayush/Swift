# Swift Syntax Learning Repository

Welcome to my Swift learning repository! This repo is where I am documenting my journey of learning the Swift programming language. I'm learning from the **Swiftfull Thinking** YouTube channel, and this is where I will keep my notes, code examples, and what I learn along the way.

## Purpose

This repository is my personal log for learning Swift. It’s not a tutorial or course, but more of a collection of notes and examples that help me remember and understand Swift better.

## How This Repo is Organized

I am learning Swift step by step. Each file or folder will contain what I’ve learned about different Swift concepts. In the future, I will add more files as I learn new topics.

## Topics I Will Cover

Here are the topics I plan to cover in the future as I continue learning Swift:

- Variables and Constants
- Data Types
- Control Flow (If, Switch)
- Functions
- Optionals
- Classes and Structs
- Closures
- Error Handling
- Protocols
- Generics

## How to Use This Repo

You can explore the repo to see my notes and code examples for each Swift concept. If you want to follow along or use it as a reference, feel free to clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/btwitsayush/Swift.git


Once you’ve cloned it, you can check out my learning progress and examples.
